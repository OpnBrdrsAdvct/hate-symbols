# Hate Symbols Collection
Collection of 214 far-right hate symbols, including descriptions, a spreadsheet (.csv format) with links to sources, 1215 images (photos and vector illustrations in .webp format), and a single-page html web file (no JavaScript; pure HTML & CSS) for local/offline viewing of the entire dataset.

## Content Warning
:warning: **Please Note: This repo contains NSFW, uncensored content, including potentially hateful imagery, graphic/violent symbolisms, offensive/discriminatory photos, etc., and is primarily being made available as an alternative source for students, researchers, and journalists.**

## Possible Uses
* The single-page HTML viewer can be used for convenient offline browsing, and enables users to quickly search the collection for terms, locations, etc. to quickly locate all related/relevant entries in the dataset _(CTRL+F on Windows/Linux; CMD+F on Mac)_
* The spreadsheet can be used for data analysis and research, as well as scraping the dataset and images and/or recreating the HTML viewer if necessary
* This dataset can be used by organizations, researchers, and website administrators to recreate a hate symbols database on their own website and/or internal systems without relying on or referring to the original source _(source is a bit outdated; dataset should be updated and unnecessary entries could be removed)_
