Since the early 1800s, the gesture increasingly became associated with the word “okay” and its abbreviation “ok.”\xa0 The gesture is also important in the Hindu and Buddhist worlds, as well as in yoga, where it is known as mudra or vitarka mudra, a symbol of inner perfection.\xa0 The ""okay"" hand gesture also forms part of the basis for a number of words or concepts in American Sign Language. It appears in many other contexts as well.', 'Use of the okay symbol in most contexts is entirely innocuous and harmless.', 'In 2017, the “okay” hand gesture acquired a new and different significance thanks to a hoax by members of the website 4chan to falsely promote the gesture as a hate symbol, claiming that the gesture represented the letters “wp,” for “white power.” The “okay” gesture hoax was merely the latest in a series of similar 4chan hoaxes using various innocuous symbols; in each case, the hoaxers hoped that the media and liberals would overreact by condemning a common image as white supremacist.', 'In the case of the “okay” gesture, the hoax was so successful the symbol became a popular trolling tactic on the part of right-leaning individuals, who would often post photos to social media of themselves posing while making the “okay” gesture.', 'Ironically, some white supremacists themselves soon also participated in such trolling tactics, lending an actual credence to those who labeled the trolling gesture as racist in nature. By 2019, at least some white supremacists seem to have abandoned the ironic or satiric intent behind the original trolling campaign and used the symbol as a sincere expression of white supremacy, such as when Australian white supremacist Brenton Tarrant flashed the symbol during a March 2019 courtroom appearance soon after his arrest for allegedly murdering 50 people in a shooting spree at mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand.', 'The overwhelming usage of the “okay” hand gesture today is still its traditional purpose as a gesture signifying assent or approval. As a result, someone who uses the symbol cannot be assumed to be using the symbol in either a trolling or, especially, white supremacist context unless other contextual evidence exists to support the contention. Since 2017, many people have been falsely accused of being racist or white supremacist for using the “okay” gesture in its traditional and innocuous sense.', 'Other, similar-seeming hand gestures have also been mistakenly assumed to have white supremacist connotations as a result of the “okay” hoax. One of these is the so-called “Circle Game,” in which people attempt to trick each other into looking at an okay-like hand gesture made somewhere below the waist. Another is the hand sign of the Three Percenter movement, a wing of the anti-government extremist militia movement. Three Percenters, who are right-wing extremists but are not typically white supremacists, often make a hand gesture to symbolize their movement that uses the outstretched middle, ring, and pinky fingers to represent a Roman numeral “3.” This gesture, from certain angles, can often resemble an “okay” hand gesture and has been misinterpreted by some as a white supremacist symbol.', 'Because of the traditional meaning of the “okay” hand gesture, as well as other usages unrelated to white supremacy, particular care must be taken not to jump to conclusions about the intent behind someone who has used the gesture.']","[""https://www.adl.orgdata:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D'http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg'%20viewBox%3D'0%200%201%201'%2F%3E"", ""https://www.adl.orgdata:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D'http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg'%20viewBox%3D'0%200%201%201'%2F%3E"", ""https://www.adl.orgdata:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D'http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg'%20viewBox%3D'0%200%201%201'%2F%3E"", ""https://www.adl.orgdata:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D'http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg'%20viewBox%3D'0%200%201%201'%2F%3E"", ""https://www.adl.orgdata:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D'http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg'%20viewBox%3D'0%200%201%201'%2F%3E"", ""https://www.adl.orgdata:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D'http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg'%20viewBox%3D'0%200%201%201'%2F%3E""]",Okay_Hand_Gesture_1.webp,"['Okay_Hand_Gesture_2.webp', 'Okay_Hand_Gesture_3.webp', 'Okay_Hand_Gesture_4.webp', 'Okay_Hand_Gesture_5.webp', 'Okay_Hand_Gesture_6.webp', 'Okay_Hand_Gesture_7.webp']"

Before the 20th century, its use (including in the United States) was almost always benign. Even today, the swastika is a common symbol across Asia, used by Hindus, Buddhists, and adherents of other religions, where it is often associated with good fortune.', 'However, in the early 20th century, various right-wing adherents of the so-called “völkisch” movement in Germany, a movement in large part dedicated to uncovering a romanticized and largely mythical German/“Aryan” past, adopted the swastika as a symbol. The use of the swastika in this context subsequently influenced Adolf Hitler to adopt the swastika as the primary symbol for the Nazi Party in 1920. The murderous legacy of the Nazi regime, especially the Holocaust, permanently converted the swastika into a symbol of hate, anti-Semitism\xa0and infamy.', 'Since 1945, the swastika has served as the most significant and notorious of hate symbols, anti-Semitism\xa0and white supremacy for most of the world outside of Asia. Its display is prohibited in Germany and some other countries, leading some right-wing extremists to devise variants or alternatives to the swastika that would evoke a similar effect. In the United States, the swastika is overwhelmingly viewed as a hate symbol.', 'The swastika as adopted by the Nazis has “arms” that hook to the right; later white supremacists maintained this tradition. Though sometimes more ignorant white supremacists accidentally render swastikas “backwards,” the backwards or left-pointing swastika is typically the hallmark of someone not actually that familiar with white supremacist iconography. The swastika, along with the letters “KKK” and the numbers “666,” is one of the most common forms of “shock” graffiti in the United States, typically spray-painted by juveniles who are not actually white supremacists but simply want to use the image to shock and alarm people.', 'Among white supremacists, the swastika is a very common symbol, rendered in many different ways and often combined with other hate symbols. The most common swastika variant is a round or curved swastika. Since the release of “American History X,” a favorite movie of white supremacists, it has been very common for male white supremacists to get a swastika tattoo on their left breast in imitation of the main character in that movie. One trend seen most often in California among members of white power gangs is the popularity of very large outline swastika tattoos.']","['https://www.adl.org/sites/default/files/styles/content_card_image_large/public/images/combating-hate/hate-on-display/c/swastika-2.jpg.webp', 'https://www.adl.org/sites/default/files/styles/content_card_image_large/public/images/combating-hate/hate-on-display/c/swastika-3.jpg.webp', 'https://www.adl.org/sites/default/files/styles/content_card_image_large/public/images/combating-hate/hate-on-display/c/swastika-4.jpg.webp', 'https://www.adl.org/sites/default/files/styles/content_card_image_large/public/images/combating-hate/hate-on-display/c/swastika-5.jpg.webp', 'https://www.adl.org/sites/default/files/styles/content_card_image_large/public/images/combating-hate/hate-on-display/c/swastika-6.jpg.webp', 'https://www.adl.org/sites/default/files/styles/content_card_image_large/public/images/combating-hate/hate-on-display/c/swastika-7.jpg.webp']",Swastika_1.webp,"['Swastika_2.webp', 'Swastika_3.webp', 'Swastika_4.webp', 'Swastika_5.webp', 'Swastika_6.webp', 'Swastika_7.webp']"

The symbol consists of three curved or jointed segments spiraling from a common center. One version of the triskele, with three human legs, has been used in the coat of arms for the Isle of Man and the Kingdom of Naples. An abstracted triskele appears on the seal of the United States Department of Transportation. The triskele appears in many different variations, from a form that looks like a three-pointed swastika to forms that employ curved lines and curlicues. What they share are three segments emanating from a single central point.', 'The triskele was one of many ancient European symbols appropriated by the Nazis. Following World War II, the triskele became a significant hate symbol, largely because of its use by the Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging (AWB), a South African white supremacist group that formed in the 1970s. The AWB used a flag similar to the Nazi flag but which replaced the swastika with a triskele that resembled three interlocking sevens.', 'Because of the AWB usage, it is this ""three sevens"" version of the triskele that is most commonly associated with white supremacy. It is a common type of white supremacist tattoo and appears in places such as the logo for the racist skinhead group Blood & Honour.', 'White supremacists do use other variations of the triskele, too, such as curved triskeles, but so do a much larger number of non-extremists.
